# edc-multitool :wrench:
A collection of personal scripts used to make (my) life just a bit easier.

### Current Toolkit:
* `batchopen`/`#batchopen` - reads through a directory's `.edc` file for the `#batchopen` tag before running `xdg-open` for each following file until the next tag is reached

### Notes:
* Make sure to have an extra blank line at the end of the `.edc` file for intended behavior
