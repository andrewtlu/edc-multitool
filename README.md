# edc-multitool :wrench:

A collection of personal scripts used to make (my) life just a bit easier.

### Current Toolkit:

- `batchopen`/`#batchopen` - reads through a directory's `.edc` file for the `#batchopen` tag before running `xdg-open` for each following file until the next tag is reached
- `./honorcode.sh` - pastes the Emory honor code message in a README.txt at the location specified in argument 1 (made for CS 334)
- `source activate.sh` - activates the Python virtual environment in the current directory, returning the active Python instance

### Notes:

- Make sure to have an extra blank line at the end of the `.edc` file for intended behavior
