# edc-multitool :wrench:
A collection of personal scripts used to make (my) life just a bit easier.

### Current Toolkit:
* `pdfopen`/`#pdfopen` - reads through a directory's `.edc` file for the `#pdfopen` tag before running `open` for each following line until the next tag is reached

### Notes:
* Make sure to have an extra blank line at the end of the `.edc` file for intended behavior
